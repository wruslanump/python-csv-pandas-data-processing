	to update displayed data when a buffer fault occurs.

** Nov 04, 2008 **
	Navigability of huge datasets has been enhanced. The selected cell is now
	properly updated when a buffer fault occurs. It means that navigating the
	table with the keyboard works fine now.

	parent group if it was closed. So user can see that the node has really been
	added.

** Oct 22, 2008 **
	More progresses in the datasets displaying:
	- the workspace and the tree of databases are synchronized now: if a leaf
		with a view is selected in the tree then the view becomes active in the
		workspace. And viceversa, if a view is activated in the workspace its leaf
		is automatically selected in the tree
	- when a node with views is overwritten (because a group has been created, a
		node has been renamed or a node has been pasted/dropped) the views are
		closed
	- the drag and drop behavior has been debugged

** Oct 21, 2008 **

** Oct 20, 2008 **
	The Windows menu has been reimplemented.

** Oct 19, 2008 **

	now :-)

** Oct 11, 2008 **
	The code for renaming nodes has been refactored. Affected modules are
	vtapp.py, utils.py, inputNodeName.py and renameDlg.py.

	The setup.py has been updated.

** Sep 26, 2008 **

  but VERSION.

** Jul 18, 2008 **
  The nodeProperties subpackage is being ported. At the moment the GUI
  part has been ported. Next step will be porting the code for attributes
  validation.

** Jul 15, 2008 **
  Fixed a nasty bug that crashed the application every time a node was
  expanded in the tree viewer. The reported Qt4 error was:

  QObject: Do not delete object during its event handling!

  I've been unable to locate exactly where the bug was. Apparently it was
  produced by a strange interaction between VTApp and VTGUI classes so
  I've embedded VTGUI in VTApp and removed the vtgui.py module. It seems
  to fix the bug.

** Jul 07, 2008 **
  The porting of the nodeProperties subpackage has started.

  A new module, nodeDoc.py, has been added. It is in charge of the
  information collection about a given PyTables node. This module makes
  unnecessary the following ones: nodeDoc.py, tableDoc.py, arrayDoc.py,
  unimplementedDoc.py and groupDoc.py. All those modules have been
  removed from the project.

** Jul 03, 2008 **

  crash.

  Implemented Node --> New Group command with overwriting support.

** Apr 02, 2008 **
  The overwriting feature has been implemented in the drag and drop of
  nodes.

  In this note it is  specified how the ViTables program is licensed.

** Mar 27, 2008 **
  Copyright statement of source files has been updated.

  ViTables logo has changed: now it doesn't contain the Carabos logo.
  I've done this because now ViTables is not developed by Carabos Coop.
  V.. Instead it is a free software project maintained by myself.

  The ViTables source code license has changed. From now on it has a
  GPLv3 license.

** Mar 26, 2008 **
  Creating a branche for porting ViTables to PyQt4.

  Fixed a little problem in the drag and drop support of the tree of
  databases  model/view.

  The treeEditor subpackage has been removed.

  The functionality of the File menu has been implemented. Only
  overwritting files during a File --> Save as... operation remains
  unimplemented.

  Fixed a couple of bugs in the tree of databases model:
  - the close database operation didn't remove the node from the tree
    view.
  - when opening a database fails the returned value was no specified.

  The configuration module has been rewritten.

  The configuration module has been rewritten.

  Small changes introduced in several modules: the name of some
  attributes has changed and some imports have been slightly modified.

  Small changes introduced in several modules: the name of some
  attributes has changed and some imports have been slightly modified.

** Mar 20, 2008 **
  The vtgui.py module has been refactored and some small problems have
  been fixed: the size of the toolbars icons, the WhatsThis action
  setup, and the setup of the menu with entries for the toolbars.

  The vtgui.py module porting is done. The result is a module much
  shorter and clearer thant it was before.

** Mar 19, 2008 **
  The porting of the vtgui.py module has started. It has been greatly
  simplified.

  The drag and drop behavior of the tree of databases view has been
  debugged a little bit.

  PyQt4.QtXXX libraries are now imported as QtCore and QtGui instead of
  qtCore and qtGui. In addition a couple of modules have some minor
  changes.

** Mar 18, 2008 **
  Copy, cut, paste and delete operations have been implemented in the
  tree of databases model. Overwriting has not been considered yet.

** Mar 05, 2008 **
  Basic drag and drop of the tree of databases model/view works!
  Nodes can be moved from one location to another (even in a different
  file). Nodes that belong to files opened in read-only mode cannot be
  dragged. Lazy population of the model works fine too.

** Mar 03, 2008 **
  The basic model/view implementation for the tree of opened databases
  is done. Databases can be opened and closed. The object tree of a
  given database is populated in a lazy way so that performance is
  guaranteed when opening files with a large number of nodes. Finally,
  icons are tied to nodes in the tree view.

** Feb 29, 2008 **
  Drag and drop support is being implemented.

** Feb 27, 2008 **
  Added basic support for renaming nodes in-place.

** Feb 26, 2008 **
  Added support for custom context menus to the tree of databases view.

  Some modules have been changed in order to keep internal consistency.

  Minor modifications made in several modules.

  * scripts/vitables
  * vitables/utils.py
  * vitables/vtsplash.py
  * vitables/vtSite.py
  * vitables/vtgui.py
    This module has been split in two modules: logger class is defined
    in a new module now.
  * vitables/logger.py

  The whole preferences subpackage has been ported:
  * vitables/preferences/vtconfig.py
  * vitables/preferences/preferences.py
  * vitables/preferences/configException.py

  The following tests have been ported:
  * vitables/preferences/preferencesGUI.py

  * tests/preferences/test_preferences.py

** Dec 16, 2007 **
  The Spanish translation has been updated.

  WhatsThis help texts and some About... texts have been reformatted in
  order to improve the code readability.

** Dec 14, 2007 **
  The previous bug fix in the editing of the TITLE system attribute was
  incomplete. It has been corrected now (hopefuly).

** Dec 13, 2007 **
  Fixed a bug in the editing of the TITLE system attribute (accents
  raised errors).

  Some trivial enhancements have been done.

  The editing of user attributes has been improved. Overflow cases are
  now properly detected and a ValueError is raised. Although this is not
  the default behavior of numpy arrays (which are silently converted to
  the apropriate dtype when an overflow occurs) it seems more adequated
  for an end user application as ViTables.

** Nov 29, 2007**
  Drag and drop of nodes has been debugged. Cut and paste has been improved.
  I hope that editing nodes is now implemented in a quite robust way.

** Nov 28, 2007**
  The behaviour of the documentation browser has been improved.
  A couple of bugs have been fixed:
  - canceling the Open File... command works fine now
  - opening a new documentation browser doesn't give errors due to not found
    documents
  - trying to open a document that doesn't exist don't shows a blank page but a
    page with the message 'Document Not found'

  A mess due to the use of backslashes still happened on Windows platforms,
  specially in the list of recent files and in the navigation browser history
  and	bookmarks. This problem has been hopefully solved.

  The copy and paste operation has been enhanced. Now a node can be copied and
  pasted in its parent group. The overwrite dialog is raised, giving you the
  chance to rename the pasted node. If you decide to overwrite, the operation
  fails (a PyTable exception is raised) because a node cannot be overwritten
  by itself.


** Nov 27, 2007**
  The template script that generates the Windows installer has been updated.
  Now it takes care of the available translations.

  Unittests have been updated.

  The search method for locating the application settings has been improved on
  Mac OS X platforms.


** Nov 26, 2007**
  Spanish translation added.

  A couple of minor problems have been fixed:
  - the .vitables directory is not created on Mac OS X platforms anymore
  - the message raised when a directory is dropped on the tree viewer is now
    clearer

  The User's Guide has been updated.


** Nov 23, 2007**
  Displaying of objects in tables widgets has been enhanced. Now cell contents
  are dynamically adapted to the available room. It means that how the content
  of a given cell is displayed depends on the column width. As a consequence,
  the displaying of multidimensional objects has been greatly improved.

  Some changes aimed to improve the i18n have been done.


** Nov 21, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the creation of user attributes with dtype float32.

  Errors raised during user attributes editing are displayed in the attributes
  editing dialog, not in the logger. This make easier to user to realise that
  an error has been raised.


** Nov 19, 2007**
  The release version has been updated.

  The User's Guide source has been updated.

  The DocBrowser behavior has been enhanced. Opening a file for the very first
  time in the DocBrowser uses the home directory as a working directory.
  Before it used the installation directory which was ugly.


** Nov 02, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the access to VLArrays elements. The bug avoided the creation
  of views for VLArrays.

  VERSION has been updated in vtSite.py. This is required in order to run
  properly on Mac OS X platforms because on these platforms the module is NOT
  overwritten by setup.py.

  The temporary database is not removed when quitting ViTables because on
  Windows platforms a Permission denied error is raised.


**Oct 31, 2007**
  Explicit support for addressing 64 bit space has been added. Now ViTables
  can display tables with more than 2**32 rows with no problem.

  A small bug has been fixed (hopefully) in the node paste operation: pasting
  a node on an expanded group doesn't refresh the object tree i.e. the pasted
  node is not visible.

  The whole unittest directory has been updated/refactored/debugged.

  I forgot to update tests/test_all.py in the previous commit :-(

  Fixed a small bug in the File Save As... procedure. The file extension of
  the new file was generated in a wrong way because the full filepath was used
  to determine the extension. The right thing is to use the filename.

**Oct 30, 2007**
  The Users' Guide has been updated.

  A specific icons has been given to the toobar button in charge of opening
  files so that users can appreciate that it can show a popup menu now.

  Fixed a bug in File --> Close All and Query --> Delete All. Closing a set of
  non selected nodes caused a wrong update of the QAction in charge of
  closing all open files. Deleting a set of non selected filtered tables
  caused a wrong update of the QAction in charge of deleting all filtered
  tables.

  Fixed a bug in the procedure used to close a database. A race condition has
  been removed.

  A new icon has been added.

  Fixed a bug in the updating of query QActions. The bug couldn't be
  appreciated by users because it happened when the application was about to
  exit.

**Oct 26, 2007**
  The VERSION file has been updated.

  A new usability enhancement has been added. The Open button of the File
  toolbar is able now to open the file of Recent files too.

**Oct 22, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the initial setup of the application.

  Fixed a bug in the Properties dialog of empty groups.

  Creating and renaming node operations have been made more robust.

  Fixed a small problem of name qualification when accessing to a couple of
  PyQt attributes.

**Oct 19, 2007**
  Usability of Properties dialog has been improved by fixing the visual
  behavior of attributes editing.

  The format given to catched errors has changed again. Now the readability of
  Syntax Errors is better.

  In the Filter Table dialog ValueErrors are explicitely catched now.

**Oct 18, 2007**
  Some classes still were instantiated via apply(qt.QSomeWidget.__init__,
  (self,args)). Now qt.QSomeWidget.__init__(self, args) is used.

  A small bug in the template installer script has been fixed. The uninstaller
  didn't remove completely the ViTables entry from the Start menu.

**June 20, 2007**
  The mingwm10.dll library must be included in the installed ViTables because
  qt and pyqt have been compiled dinamically with the MinGW compiler. The
  Makefile mswindows/Makefile_windows and the template NSIS script
  mswindows/vitables.nsi.in have been modified to take care of this dependency.

    every opened view under the selected group when the Close view action was
    launched.

  - the icons dictionary was recreated every time an icon was required by the

  included anymore in the ViTables installer for Windows. Instead numpy will
  be included so the numarray license has been substituted by the numpy one in
  the 3rd_party_licenses directory.

  The examples directory has been updated. Most of the .h5 files are now
  PyTables 2.0 files.

**Mar 19, 2007**
